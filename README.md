# SECURE-DATA-HIDING-IN-IMAGES-USING-STEGANOGRAPHY
This is a simple implementation of image-based steganography, where messages are hidden within an image and set with a password which is retrieved using the same passowrd. The encryption and decryption processes involve modifying the pixel values of an image to store message bytes without loss in image quality.

# Features
- Hide a message inside an image using pixel manipulation with no loss in image quality.
- Secure the message with a password.
- Extract the hidden message only with the correct password.
- Simple and lightweight implementation using Python and OpenCV.

# Requirement
Install Python from the official website:
[Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3132/)
Make sure to install the IDLE alongside the installation of python and set environment variable.
The following dependencies are necessary to run the scripts, to install use the below command on your terminal:
`pip install opencv-python`

# Guide to get Started
## To Encrypt
In order to hide a message in an image use the below command on your terminal where the project files exist:
`python Image-encryptor.py`
### Steps:
  1. After running the script, the script will require an image, it will ask for `image.jpg`.
  2. Enter the message you want to hide.
  3. Enter a password in order to secure the image or if you want it without password just give the enter key.
  4. The encrypted image is saved as `encImage.png`.
  5. The password is stored in `Key.txt`.

## To Decrypt
In order to retrieve the hidden message from the `encImage.png`:
`python Image-decryptor.py -i encImage.png -p password`
### Steps:
  1. The script takes the input for the input field `-i` the encypted image.
  2. Provide the correct password in the `-p` field or after the script prompts to enter.
  3. If only correct password is entered the script will output the hidden message from the `encImage.png`. Else it fail with the output `Wrong Password, Try again!`.

# File Desc
1. encrypt.py - Script to hide a message into an image.
2. decrypt.py - Script to extract the secret message hidden inside the provided encrypted image.
3. encImage.png- Image with the hidden message.
4. Key.txt - Textfile with the password, which was used to set security.
5. Pic.jpg - Unencrypted image which will be used to encrypt with a message.

# Example
## Encryption:
```
Enter the message to be encrypted: This is my project
Enter the password to secure your image: easypassword
'encImage.png' is your encrypted image
```
## Decryption:
```
Enter the password used during encryption: easypassword
'This is my project' was the encrypted message decrypted from 'encImage.png' `
```
 # Edge case
 Since during the encryption in the image, the pixel values with message bytes gets replaced, the message length shouldn't be longer than the image size.
